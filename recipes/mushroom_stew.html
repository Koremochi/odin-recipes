        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hearty Instant Pot® stew that substitutes beef with mushrooms. I used peas and lima beans from my freezer. You could use just about anything. I used red beans for protein.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®), add butter, and select Saute function. Add onions, carrots, and celery; saute until onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add chopped and sliced baby bella mushrooms, white mushrooms, and wine to the pot; sweat mushrooms until soft and alcohol has cooked off, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt, Cajun seasoning, paprika, thyme, sage, and red pepper flakes. Add stewed tomatoes with juice, tomato paste, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic. Simmer until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion mixture back to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes, kidney beans, peas, lima beans, parsley, and bay leaves; stir until combined and bay leaves are submerged. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in sour cream, followed by cornstarch if thickening is needed.</li>
        </ol>
