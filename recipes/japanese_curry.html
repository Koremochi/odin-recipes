<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Curry has always been a passion of mine, especially Japanese Curry. After years of searching I have discovered the perfect Japanese Curry. Many of these spices can be found at your local Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern markets, or substituted with S&BÂ® Oriental Curry Powder. Well worth the effort - your family will love this! Serve over steamed rice or noodles.</p>
